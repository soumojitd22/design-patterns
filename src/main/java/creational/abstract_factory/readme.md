# Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory method is a creational design pattern.

#### Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

1. A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.
2. Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.

You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.


#### Usage
- Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.
- Consider implementing the Abstract Factory when you have a class with a set of Factory Methods that blur its primary responsibility.
